  <p><em>Where value shifts in AI infrastructure—and what it means for your competitive strategy</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The most consequential number in AI infrastructure isn&rsquo;t about model size or training compute. It&rsquo;s 35 percent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the compound annual growth rate McKinsey projects for AI inference workloads through 2030—when inference will consume more than 90 gigawatts of data center capacity and represent over half of all AI compute demand. Training workloads, by comparison, will grow at 22 percent CAGR. The infrastructure story is shifting from building bigger models to serving them faster.</p>
<p>For business strategists, this isn&rsquo;t an infrastructure detail. It&rsquo;s a fundamental reordering of where value accrues in the AI economy.</p>
<h2 id="the-economics-have-flipped">The Economics Have Flipped</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the pattern I&rsquo;ve seen before: every technology wave starts with capital-intensive creation and shifts toward revenue-linked consumption.</p>
<p>Early cloud computing was about building data centers. Value accrued to construction. Then value shifted to utilization—to the companies that could sell compute cycles efficiently. The same transition is now happening in AI, but faster and with higher stakes.</p>
<p>Training AI models is capital-intensive infrastructure work. You spend hundreds of millions building a frontier model, and the commercial impact remains indirect. You can&rsquo;t easily trace the money spent training GPT-5 to specific revenue events. It&rsquo;s a bet on capability.</p>
<p>Inference is different. Every time someone asks ChatGPT a question, every recommendation engine that surfaces a product, every autonomous agent that executes a transaction—that&rsquo;s inference. And inference costs are recurring and directly tied to revenue generation. McKinsey&rsquo;s research makes this explicit: training costs are &ldquo;often hard to link directly to commercial impact,&rdquo; while inference costs are &ldquo;usually recurring and directly tied to revenue generation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The strategic implication is significant: companies that control access to low-latency inference capacity will capture recurring revenue streams. Companies that only train models own assets; companies that serve inference at scale own markets.</p>
<h2 id="two-architectures-two-strategic-positions">Two Architectures, Two Strategic Positions</h2>
<p>The shift from training to inference creates fundamentally different infrastructure requirements—and fundamentally different competitive positions.</p>
<p>Training workloads tolerate latency. McKinsey notes they can accept delays of up to 100 milliseconds between adjacent regions. That&rsquo;s why hyperscalers can site training facilities in remote, power-rich areas where grid capacity, land, and water are more available. Training doesn&rsquo;t need to be close to users; it needs to be cheap.</p>
<p>Inference workloads demand proximity. They require roughly 15 milliseconds of latency or less between adjacent regions. That&rsquo;s why hyperscalers are co-locating inference clusters within existing cloud campuses rather than isolating them in remote training sites. McKinsey reports that 70 percent of new core campuses now combine general compute and inference, &ldquo;often separated by building or data halls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This split creates two distinct strategic positions in AI infrastructure:</p>
<p><strong>Training Position</strong>: You compete on capital efficiency and power access. Winners are companies that can secure gigawatt-scale power in remote locations, tolerate long build timelines, and optimize for throughput over latency. This is increasingly a game for hyperscalers and well-capitalized AI labs.</p>
<p><strong>Inference Position</strong>: You compete on proximity and responsiveness. Winners are companies that can place compute close to users, minimize latency, and provide consistent availability. This is where enterprises building AI-enabled services must focus.</p>
<p>The companies that will struggle are those trying to compete on both dimensions without the capital to do so—the &ldquo;we&rsquo;re building our own AI&rdquo; enterprises that don&rsquo;t understand they&rsquo;re actually competing for inference capacity, not training capability.</p>
<h2 id="decision-surfaces-need-inference-not-training">Decision Surfaces Need Inference, Not Training</h2>
<p>This is where the infrastructure economics intersect with competitive strategy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written about Decision Surfaces—the interfaces where customers delegate choices to AI agents. A Decision Surface might be a voice assistant that handles customer service, a recommendation engine that curates purchasing options, or an autonomous agent that executes transactions on a user&rsquo;s behalf. These interfaces are becoming the competitive battleground for customer relationships.</p>
<p>Every Decision Surface runs on inference.</p>
<p>When a customer interacts with your AI assistant, they&rsquo;re not training a model. They&rsquo;re invoking inference—sending a query, getting a response, making a decision. The quality of that interaction depends on latency, availability, and consistency. If your inference infrastructure is slow, your Decision Surface fails. If it&rsquo;s unreliable, customers delegate to competitors.</p>
<p>This creates a strategic imperative that most enterprises haven&rsquo;t recognized: securing inference capacity is becoming as important as securing supply chain capacity. You can&rsquo;t build a competitive Decision Surface if you can&rsquo;t guarantee sub-second response times at scale.</p>
<h2 id="the-capacity-crunch-is-real">The Capacity Crunch Is Real</h2>
<p>The McKinsey data reveals a constraint that amplifies the competitive dynamics: inference capacity is becoming genuinely scarce.</p>
<p>Global data center demand is projected to reach 219 gigawatts by 2030, with AI inference alone consuming over 90 GW—roughly 42 percent of total demand. Meanwhile, time-to-power in tier 1 markets like northern Virginia has stretched to 36 months or longer. Hyperscalers are pivoting to tier 2 markets where power can be delivered 12 to 24 months faster.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t abstract infrastructure planning. It&rsquo;s competitive positioning.</p>
<p>Enterprises that assume they can simply purchase inference capacity when needed may find themselves rationed, throttled, or priced out. The hyperscalers capturing 70 percent of new capacity will prioritize their own services and their highest-value customers. Everyone else competes for what remains.</p>
<p>The strategic response isn&rsquo;t to build your own data centers—that&rsquo;s a capital-intensive distraction from core business. The strategic response is to secure inference access early, through long-term contracts, strategic partnerships, or cloud commitments that guarantee capacity and latency.</p>
<h2 id="three-strategic-positions-in-the-inference-economy">Three Strategic Positions in the Inference Economy</h2>
<p>As inference becomes the dominant workload, enterprises face a strategic choice about how to position themselves:</p>
<p><strong>Position 1: Inference Capacity Owners</strong></p>
<p>Some companies will own or control significant inference capacity and sell access to others. This is the hyperscaler play—AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, plus the GPU cloud providers like CoreWeave and Lambda. They capture value by selling compute cycles at premium prices to enterprises that need guaranteed access.</p>
<p>For most enterprises, this isn&rsquo;t a viable strategy. The capital requirements are prohibitive, and the operational complexity of running AI infrastructure at scale is substantial.</p>
<p><strong>Position 2: Decision Surface Operators</strong></p>
<p>Companies in this position don&rsquo;t own inference infrastructure; they build differentiated Decision Surfaces that run on purchased inference capacity. They compete on the quality of their AI-enabled customer interactions, the intelligence of their recommendation engines, the effectiveness of their autonomous agents.</p>
<p>This is where most enterprises should compete. Your competitive advantage isn&rsquo;t in owning GPUs; it&rsquo;s in building the interfaces where customers delegate decisions. You need reliable inference access, but you don&rsquo;t need to own it.</p>
<p>The risk in this position is dependency. If your inference provider throttles your capacity or raises prices, your Decision Surfaces degrade. Strategic hedging—multi-cloud architectures, capacity reservations, long-term contracts—becomes essential.</p>
<p><strong>Position 3: Inference-Light Businesses</strong></p>
<p>Some businesses will remain relatively inference-light, using AI for internal productivity but not competing on AI-enabled customer interfaces. They&rsquo;ll consume AI through packaged SaaS applications rather than building custom Decision Surfaces.</p>
<p>This is a viable strategy for some, but it carries its own risk: as competitors build AI-enabled customer experiences, inference-light businesses may find themselves unable to match the responsiveness and personalization customers come to expect.</p>
<h2 id="the-timing-question">The Timing Question</h2>
<p>When should enterprises move to secure inference capacity?</p>
<p>The McKinsey data suggests the window is narrowing. Inference workloads are growing at 35 percent CAGR. Time-to-power in premium markets exceeds three years. Hyperscalers are locking in capacity for their own services.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a counterargument: efficiency improvements are advancing rapidly. Hardware advances are lowering energy per compute. Software optimizations are reducing runtime requirements. Smaller, fine-tuned models are replacing monolithic systems. McKinsey acknowledges these trends &ldquo;could moderate growth toward CAGRs of 4 to 7 percent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The strategic answer is to hedge: secure enough inference capacity to support your Decision Surface roadmap, but don&rsquo;t over-commit to current architectures. The inference economy rewards flexibility—the ability to scale up when demand materializes and scale down when efficiency improvements change the economics.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-means-for-strategic-planning">What This Means for Strategic Planning</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a CEO or CSO planning your AI strategy, here&rsquo;s the framework:</p>
<p><strong>Recognize the workload shift.</strong> AI strategy isn&rsquo;t primarily about training models; it&rsquo;s about serving inference at scale. Your AI roadmap should start with the Decision Surfaces you&rsquo;re building for customers, then work backward to the inference capacity required to power them.</p>
<p><strong>Audit your inference dependencies.</strong> Map every AI-enabled customer interaction to its inference infrastructure. Understand your latency requirements, your capacity constraints, and your vendor dependencies. Most enterprises don&rsquo;t know how exposed they are.</p>
<p><strong>Secure capacity before you need it.</strong> Inference capacity is becoming scarce in premium markets. Long-term contracts, committed use discounts, and strategic partnerships with cloud providers should be part of your procurement strategy, not an afterthought.</p>
<p><strong>Design for latency.</strong> If your Decision Surfaces require sub-15-millisecond response times, you need inference capacity in the right geographic locations. Remote compute doesn&rsquo;t work for latency-sensitive applications.</p>
<p><strong>Build flexibility.</strong> The inference economy is evolving rapidly. Lock in enough capacity for current needs, but architect for portability. Multi-cloud strategies, containerized workloads, and vendor-agnostic interfaces preserve optionality as the market develops.</p>
<h2 id="the-value-shift-is-underway">The Value Shift Is Underway</h2>
<p>The AI infrastructure buildout is a $7 trillion investment thesis. But the value won&rsquo;t accrue evenly across that investment.</p>
<p>Training infrastructure is necessary but increasingly commoditized. The frontier AI labs have already made their training bets. For most enterprises, training capability is something you rent, not something you build.</p>
<p>Inference infrastructure is where the competitive dynamics are intensifying. The companies that secure reliable, low-latency inference capacity will build the Decision Surfaces that capture customer relationships. The companies that don&rsquo;t will find themselves dependent on AI services they can&rsquo;t differentiate.</p>
<p>The inference economy is emerging. The strategic positioning is happening now.</p>
